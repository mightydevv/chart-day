Welcome to Chart Day, an app all about dragons and dungeons! This app is designed to help players of tabletop RPGs, specifically those who play games like Dungeons & Dragons, keep track of their characters and their progress through their adventures.

Features:

Character Sheet: Keep track of your character's stats, abilities, equipment, and spells all in one place. No need to flip through multiple pages in a physical handbook!

Dungeon Master Tools: If you're a Dungeon Master, this app has tools to help you run your game. Keep track of initiative order, set up encounters with custom monsters, and create loot tables for treasure drops.

Campaign Tracker: Keep track of your campaign's progress with the Campaign Tracker. Keep notes on NPCs, locations, and plot points, so you never forget what happened in previous sessions.
